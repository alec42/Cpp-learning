To start learning C++, I used [this website](https://www.learncpp.com/). 

##  Setting up
Need to insure that C++ is installed on the computer. This program is called g++

##  Executing code
Code can be compiled directly from the command line with the command 
`g++ -o file_write_output file_code.cpp -pedantic-errors -Wall -Weffc++ -Wextra -Wsign-conversion`.
+   The `-o` flag tells C++ to write the __o__utput to the specified file of the cpp source code
+   The `-pedantic-errors` flag is reccomended by the tutorial to be as strict as possible
To then run the code, we run it like any other shell script: `./file_write_output`
+   The `-Wall -Weffc++ -Wextra -Wsign-conversion` flag is to have the maximum warnings
    and is strongly reccomended, especially while learning.

##  Compilers
The tutorial explains that there are multiple compilers and that it's possible
for C++ code to compile in one but not the other. For this reason they reccomend 
to disable all individualities of the compiler to follow a standard with the 
`-pedantic-errors` being very strict.
